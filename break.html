      <h1>Hey everyone.</h1>
      <br>
      <p>I'm taking a (pretty large) break from all of my projects (including
        theShell.) No, I'm not dead, rather, I have some important things to do
        in real life. I may come and work on some of my projects and add a
        little bit of code during my break, but nothing too major is going to
        happen. </p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>Hopefully theShell 4.0 is stable enough for the next year or so, so
        that there aren't too many bugs while I'm gone.</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>If something really important, like a breaking change in Qt where
        theShell doesn't compile correctly, or a really critical security bug,
        I'll try to address it as fast as I possibly can. No guarantees about
        that, though. Do <a href="mailto:vicr12345@gmail.com">tell me</a> if
        something like this happens so I can try to rectify it.</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>Alternatively, if you do find a bug and want to fix it, please do play
        around with the code and send me a pull request so that I can integrate
        the code into theShell (or any of my other projects.) Thanks :)</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>I expect to be back at the end of 2017, and then I should be able to
        begin maintaining all my apps and adding features to them again.</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>In the mean time, don't expect any major app updates or new features to
        come out.</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks everyone,</p>
      <p>Victor :)</p>
